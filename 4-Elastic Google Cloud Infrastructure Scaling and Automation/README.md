# About Elastic Google Cloud Infrastructure: Scaling and Automation

This course builds on the Essential Cloud Infrastructure: Core Services course and enhances your study of architecting with Compute Engine. In this course, we start by going over the different options to interconnect networks to enable you to connect your infrastructure to GCP. Next, we’ll go over GCP’s load balancing and autoscaling services, which you will get to explore directly. Then, we’ll cover infrastructure automation services like Deployment Manager and Terraform, so that you can automate the deployment of GCP infrastructure services. Lastly, we’ll talk about other managed services that you might want to leverage in GCP. Here are the modules of the course:

1. Interconnecting Networks
2. Load Balancing and Autoscaling
3. Infrastructure Automation
4. Managed Services
