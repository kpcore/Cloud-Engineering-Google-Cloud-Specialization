# Description of Managed Services

In this module, we give you an overview of BigQuery, Cloud Dataflow, Cloud Dataprep by Trifacta, and Cloud Dataproc. Now all of these services are for data analytics purposes, and since that’s not the focus of this course series, there won’t be any labs in this module. Instead, we’ll have a quick demo to illustrate how easy it is to use a managed service.
