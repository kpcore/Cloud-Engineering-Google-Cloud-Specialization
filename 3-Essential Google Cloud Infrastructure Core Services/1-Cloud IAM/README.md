# Description of Cloud IAM

In this module, we cover Cloud Identity and Access Management (or Cloud IAM). Cloud IAM is a sophisticated system built on top of email-like address names, job-type roles, and granular permissions. If you're familiar with IAM from other implementations, look for the differences that Google has implemented to make IAM easier to administer and more secure.

## KEY CONCEPTS

* Describe the Cloud IAM resource hierarchy
* Explain the different types of IAM roles
