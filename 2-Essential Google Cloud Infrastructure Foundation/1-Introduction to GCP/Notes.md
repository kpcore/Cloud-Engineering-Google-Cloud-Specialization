## 1. Module Overview

* We will be covering virtual networks. GCP uses a software-defined network that is built on a global fiber infrastructure. This infrastructure makes GCP one of the world's largest and fastest networks. Thinking about resources as services instead of as hardware, will help you understand the options that are available and their behavior.
* In this module, we start by introducing virtual private cloud or VPC, which is Google's managed networking functionality for your cloud platform resources. Then we dissect networking into its fundamental components which are projects, networks, subnetworks, IP addresses, routes and firewall rules, along with network pricing.
* Next, you will explore GCP's network structure in a lab by creating networks of many different varieties and exploring the network of relationships between them
* On a high level, GCP consists of regions, points of presence or PoPs, a global private network, and services. A region is a specific geographical location where you can run your resources. The number on each region represents the zones within that region.
* The PoPs are where Google's network is connected to the rest of the Internet. GCP can bring its traffic closer to its peers because it operates an extensive global network of interconnection points.
* This reduces costs and provides users with a they better experience. The network connects regions and PoPs and it's composed of a global network of fiber optic cables with several submarine cable investments.

## 2. Using GCP

* Four ways you can interact with GCP. There's the Google Cloud Platform console or GCP console, Cloud Shell and the Cloud SDK, the APIs and the Cloud mobile app.
* The GCP console provides a web-based graphical User Interface that you access through console. If you prefer to work in a terminal window, the Cloud SDK provides the gcloud command line tool.
* GCP, also provides Cloud Shell which is a browser-based interactive shell environment for GCP that you can access from the GCP console. Cloud Shell is a temporary Virtual Machine with five gigabytes of persistent disk storage that has the Cloud SDK pre-installed.
* GCP Client Libraries expose APIs for two main purposes. App APIs provide access to services, and they're optimized for supported languages such as Node. js or Python. Admin APIs offer functionality for resource management. The Cloud mobile app is another way to interact with GCP.
