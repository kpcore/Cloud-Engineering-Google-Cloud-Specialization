# Description of Virtual Machines

In this module, we cover virtual machine instances, or VMs. First we'll start with the basics of Compute Engine, followed by a quick little lab to get you more familiar with creating virtual machines. Then, weâ€™ll look at the different CPU and memory options that enable you to create different configurations.Next, we will look at images and the different disk options available with Compute Engine. After that, we will discuss very common Compute Engine actions that you might encounter in your day-to-day job. This will be followed by an in-depth lab that explores many of the features and services covered in this module.
